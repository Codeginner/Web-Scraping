## eBay Product Web Scraper

This is my final project of Object Oriented Programming course, departement of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering 2022. This application uses web scraping techniques to collect information about products of interest, such as name, price, seller location, and number of reviews. The project uses the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm to improve the readability, modularity, and maintainability of the code.
